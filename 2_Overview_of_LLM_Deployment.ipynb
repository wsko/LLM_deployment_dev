    "### Deploying Open-Source Large Language Models: A Performance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14887\n",
    "\n",
    "- This study evaluates the performance of open-source large language models (LLMs) like Mistral and LLaMA, focusing on their deployment on NVIDIA V100 (16 GB) and A100 (40 GB) GPUs using the vLLM Python library. \n",
    "- The research addresses the growing need for secure, transparent, and locally deployable AI solutions to counter the confidentiality risks posed by proprietary LLMs like ChatGPT, particularly in academic and research settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. **Performance Scalability**:\n",
    "   - Response times increase with larger context sizes due to quadratic complexity in memory and computation, particularly noticeable at higher prompt sizes (e.g., 2193 tokens).\n",
    "   - The vLLM library enables efficient handling of multiple requests, with response time scaling logarithmically rather than linearly. For instance, doubling simultaneous requests does not double response time.\n",
    "   - Example: Mistral-7B on 2 V100 GPUs took 1.8s for 1 request (31 tokens) but 72.1s for 128 requests (2193 tokens). Codestral-22B on 2 A100 GPUs performed better, taking 6.8s for 128 requests (31 tokens).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. **Hardware Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - Smaller models like Mistral-7B and quantized Codestral-22B can run effectively on V100 GPUs, while larger models like Mixtral-8x22B require multiple A100 GPUs.\n",
    "   - Mixtral-8x7B (MoE architecture, 49B parameters, 12-13B active) achieved up to 700 tokens/second for 128 simultaneous requests with small prompts (30 tokens) on 2 A100 GPUs, demonstrating high efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. **Quantization Benefits**:\n",
    "   - Quantization (e.g., 4-bit AWQ, 8-bit GPTQ) reduces memory requirements with negligible performance loss up to 6 bits and acceptable loss at 4 bits, enabling deployment on less powerful hardware.\n",
    "   - Codestral-22B (AWQ 4-bits) on 1 A100 GPU outperformed its GPTQ 8-bit version on 2 V100 GPUs, showing the impact of quantization and hardware combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. **Practical Deployment**:\n",
    "   - Two A100 40GB GPUs (or one 80GB GPU) can support high-performance models like LLaMA-3-70B or Mixtral-8x7B, rivaling proprietary solutions like GPT-4.\n",
    "   - Smaller models (7B to 30B parameters) offer impressive generation speeds, especially with parallelized requests, making them viable for resource-constrained environments.\n"

    "### Unveiling the Landscape of LLM Deployment in the Wild: An Empirical Study\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2505.02502\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comprehensive analysis of public-facing large language model (LLM) deployments\n",
    "- Reveals pervasive security and configuration flaws that expose these services to significant risks. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scale and Distribution**:\n",
    "   - **Global Presence**: 320,102 services were identified, with the U.S. hosting 111,728 instances, followed by China (56,593). Smaller clusters exist globally, indicating democratization but uneven infrastructure access.\n",
    "   - **Framework Dominance**: Ollama led with 155,423 instances, followed by Open WebUI (37,242) and Jan (28,445). Inference engines like vLLM (6,077) and developer tools like Jupyter Notebook (24,531) were also prevalent.\n",
    "   - **Hosting Concentration**: Major providers like Amazon (88,257 instances) and Cloudflare dominate, but a long tail of smaller vendors and hobbyist servers adds heterogeneity and inconsistent security practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Insecure Configurations**:\n",
    "   - **Plain HTTP Usage**: Over 40% (129,811) of services use unencrypted HTTP, particularly on ports tied to frameworks like Ollama (port 11434) and Jan (port 3000).\n",
    "   - **Weak TLS Practices**: Where TLS is used, outdated versions (e.g., TLS 1.0, 1.2) are common, exposing services to downgrade attacks. Over 210,000 services use generic or missing TLS certificate metadata (e.g., \"localhost\", \"nan\").\n",
    "   - **Domain and Certificate Reuse**: High-traffic domains (e.g., nellasushi.es) host thousands of services, often with shared IPs and default certificates, weakening trust models and complicating attribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **API Exposure and Authentication Gaps**:\n",
    "   - **High Responsiveness**: Frameworks like Ollama and Llamafile respond to over 80% of unauthenticated API requests, exposing endpoints for text generation, model listing (75.26% success rate), and system configuration.\n",
    "   - **Functional Exposure**: 158 endpoints across 12 categories enable risky operations like model deletion, file uploads, and queue monitoring without authentication. For example, Ollama’s /api/tags endpoint has a 70.57% exposure rate.\n",
    "   - **Inconsistent Controls**: Frameworks like Open WebUI and Jan show lower responsiveness (<2%), but partial exposures and inconsistent access controls persist.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Security Risks**:\n",
    "   - **Model Information Disclosure**: Endpoints like /show and /api/tags leak model metadata, inference histories, and deployment paths, enabling targeted attacks, prompt injection, or model theft.\n",
    "   - **System Configuration Leakage**: ComfyUI’s /system_stats (4.53% exposure) reveals OS, GPU specs (e.g., RTX 4090), and memory, facilitating resource exhaustion or platform-specific exploits. 41.28% of these lack authentication.\n",
    "   - **Unauthorized Access and Abuse**: Endpoints like /queue (1.07%) and /prompt (3.20%) allow unauthenticated task submission, enabling denial-of-service attacks, GPU hijacking, or cryptocurrency mining.\n",
    "   - **Vulnerabilities**: Exposed metadata (e.g., ComfyUI’s /extensions, 9.33%) aids reverse engineering and exploit development. Jupyter Notebook’s /api leaks version data, linking to known vulnerabilities like unauthenticated RCE.\n",
    "   - **Sensitive Content Generation**: Weak input validation in Ollama and Text Generation WebUI allows attackers to generate harmful outputs or extract proprietary data via crafted prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Systemic Issues**:\n",
    "   - **Insecure Defaults**: Frameworks prioritize ease of deployment over security, exposing APIs publicly without authentication (e.g., Ollama’s CVE-2024-37032).\n",
    "   - **Containerized Deployments**: Over 210,000 services lack valid domains, and many use minimal server stacks (e.g., Ubuntu + nginx), reducing observability and complicating audits.\n",
    "   - **Plugin Risks**: Frameworks like ComfyUI and Open WebUI suffer from plugin vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2024-6707), enabling file uploads or remote code execution.\n"

    "\n",
    "##### Core Components of LLM Deployment\n",
    "1. **Model Architecture**:\n",
    "   - **Transformers**: Dominant in modern LLMs (e.g., GPT, BERT) due to attention mechanisms, offering superior performance but high resource demands.\n",
    "   - **RNNs/LSTMs**: Less common but used for sequential tasks, with lower computational needs.\n",
    "2. **Inference Process**:\n",
    "   - Latency is influenced by model size, hardware (GPUs/TPUs), and batch processing.\n",
    "   - Optimization is critical for real-time web applications requiring fast responses.\n",
    "3. **Infrastructure**:\n",
    "   - Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) provide scalability and managed services.\n",
    "   - Edge devices reduce latency but face hardware constraints.\n",
    "   - Hybrid approaches combine cloud and edge for flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Deployment Strategies\n",
    "1. **Cloud-Based Deployment**:\n",
    "   - **API-Based**: Expose LLMs as APIs for scalability and ease of integration. Cloud platforms auto-scale resources based on demand.\n",
    "   - **Serverless Functions**: Pay-as-you-go model ideal for variable workloads, reducing costs during low traffic.\n",
    "   - **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across servers to prevent overloads, ensuring high availability.\n",
    "2. **Edge Computing**:\n",
    "   - Processes data locally to minimize latency, suitable for real-time applications (e.g., voice assistants).\n",
    "   - Challenges include limited memory and compute power on edge devices.\n",
    "3. **Hybrid Deployment**:\n",
    "   - Combines cloud for heavy tasks (e.g., training) and edge for quick responses, optimizing speed and cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Performance Optimization Techniques\n",
    "1. **Model Compression**:\n",
    "   - **Pruning**: Removes redundant weights to reduce model size and inference time, with minimal accuracy loss.\n",
    "   - **Quantization**: Lowers weight precision (e.g., 32-bit to 8-bit) to decrease memory and computation needs.\n",
    "   - **Knowledge Distillation**: Trains a smaller \"student\" model to mimic a larger \"teacher\" model, enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices.\n",
    "2. **Load Balancing and Caching**:\n",
    "   - **Load Balancing**: Distributes requests evenly to maintain performance during traffic spikes.\n",
    "   - **Caching**: Stores frequent responses to reduce model invocations, improving latency (e.g., cached product recommendations in e-commerce).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cost Optimization Strategies\n",
